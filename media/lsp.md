## What does LSP mean

LSP is an acronym for Language Server Protocol. It allows editors such as VS Code to communicate with a language server, to provide features such as code completion, navigation and formatting.

VS Code has built-in LSP support for some languages, such as TypeScript, but for Ruby it requires an extension.
